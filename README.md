# Shashwat-Chandra
This project implements a CUDA-based image processing pipeline that performs batched image operations (grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and edge detection) using NVIDIA NPP routines where applicable and custom CUDA kernels otherwise. The code is designed to process hundreds of small images or dozens of large images via a CLI.
